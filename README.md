# tran-family-survey
This is the hard-effort survey results you wanted right?

This took some time to make for you guys. I hope you downloaded it.
Any complaints will not be tolerated. A little description of this would
be that it is actually my first project ever! So I don't know if it
will turn out well. I am doing this mainly in hopes of being
able to understand computers better and you also get your long-awaited 
survey results which you could have gotten anyways if you had just 
went to the meeting we had planned out, but I guess everyone has
their extenuating circumstances

I hope you enjoy this
